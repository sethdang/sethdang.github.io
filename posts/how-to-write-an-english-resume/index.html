Most students write their first resume when they are seeking internships or summer employment, but resume writing skills are equally important for seniors approaching graduation and alumni seeking advancement.
As most people know, the purpose of the resume is to summarize the key elements of your past experience that you would like employers to consider when you are seeking employment. Naturally, a resume needs to be revised periodically during your career to reflect changes in your qualifications. Keep in mind that a good resume alone won&rsquo;t get you a job; however, it can help you get an interview and influence an employer&rsquo;s perception of your skills and potential for a particular kind of work.
There are several standard formats for resumes, but most employers prefer the chronological format, which is outlined and illustrated below. A few students might prefer to use a functional format to call attention to particular skill areas. Additional information on various resume formats is available in the Career Development Center. The organization of the resume can be adapted as necessary to emphasize an individual&rsquo;s most outstanding characteristics. In general, however, the resume should include:
IDENTIFICATION DATA: name, address (or two addresses&ndash;present and permanent), and phone number(s) (including area code).
OBJECTIVE: a single phrase expressing the specific type of employment you are seeking and/or the principal skills you want to use on the job. Some people prepare two or more resumes with different objectives. Once you formulate a clear objective, you can use it almost as a thesis for the remainder of your resume; only information that supports your career objective should be in
cluded on the resume.
EDUCATION: basic details about your education, including college location (city and state), degree, date of graduation (or expected graduation), major, related course work and (possibly) G.P.A. Most college students do not need to include information about secondary school, but it is important to summarize education attained through community colleges, other colleges (i.e., transfer credits), and specialized training programs.
EMPLOYMENT: brief summaries of principle employment to date. Start with your current (or most recent) position and work backward. Include all employment relevant to your career objective in any way. Internships and cooperative experience can be listed either under employment or under education.
Provide the name of the employer, the employer&rsquo;s location, your job title, dates of employment, and simple verb phrases to summarize your main activities on the job (see action verb list). When ever possible quantify and qualify data with specific details and statistics that illustrate your potential."><meta name=author content="Seth"><link rel=canonical href=https://seth.dpdns.org/posts/how-to-write-an-english-resume/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.e1f5c4cae44599655f7ff95195ff89c8cb3adbda94f2b1581a434ab2b4d4e6cf.css integrity="sha256-4fXEyuRFmWVff/lRlf+JyMs629qU8rFYGkNKsrTU5s8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://seth.dpdns.org/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://seth.dpdns.org/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://seth.dpdns.org/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://seth.dpdns.org/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://seth.dpdns.org/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://seth.dpdns.org/posts/how-to-write-an-english-resume/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://seth.dpdns.org/posts/how-to-write-an-english-resume/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Seth Dang'S"><meta property="og:title" content="How to write an english resume"><meta property="og:description" content="An effective resume is the foundation of every successful job campaign.

A one-page resume is best, although people with extensive experience or advanced degrees may have to use two pages. Be scrupulously careful when you proofread; some employers will refuse to consider candidates who submit resumes with spelling or typographical errors.\nACTION VERBS FOR JOB DESCRIPTIONS\nVerb phrases are the strongest way to describe previous job responsibilities. To write verb phrases, pretend you’re telling someone about your job, beginning each sentence with I. . . . For example, I supervise ten employees. I organize mass mailings. I arrange airline and hotel reservations. On the resume, you omit the I and use only the remaining verb phrases to descri\nbe the work you do: Supervise ten employees. Organize mass mailings. Arrange airline and hotel reservations. Use present tense verb phrases for jobs you currently hold and past tense for former jobs. If you have any difficulty finding the right verbs to describe your work, choose from the following list:\naccomplished achieved\nacquired acted\nadapted addressed\nadjusted administered\nadvanced advised\nallocated analyzed\napplied appraised\napproved arranged\nassembled assigned\nassisted attained\naudited author\nautomated balanced\nbrought budgeted\nbuilt calculated\ncatalogued chaired\nchanged clarified\ncoached collected\ncommunicated compared\ncompiled completed\ncomposed computed\ncomputerized conceptualized\nconceived concluded\nconducted conserved\nconsolidated contained\ncontinued contracted\ncontributed controlled\ncoordinated corrected\ncorresponded counseled\ncreated critiqued\ncut decreased\ndelegated decided\ndefined delivered\ndemonstrated determined\ndesigned developed\ndevised diagnosed\ndirected dispatched\ndistinguished distributed\ndiversified drafted\nedited educated\neliminated enabled\nencouraged engineered\nenlisted established\nensured estimated\nevaluated examined\nexecuted expanded\nexpedited extracted\nfabricated facilitated\nfamiliarized fashioned\nfinalized focused\nforecast formulated\nfounded gathered\ngenerated graded\nguided handled\nheaded up identified\nillustrated implemented\nimproved increased\nindoctrinated influenced\ninformed initiated\ninnovated inspected\ninstructed insured\nintegrated interpreted\ninterviewed introduced\ninvented investigated\nkept launched\nlectured led\nmade maintained\nmanaged manufactured\nmarketed mediated\nmoderated modified\nmonitored motivated\nnegotiated observed\noperated ordered\norganized originated\noutsold overhauled\noversaw participated\nperformed persuaded\nplanned prepared\npresented presided\nprioritized processed\nproduced programmed\nprojected promoted\nproposed provided\npublicized published\npurchased recommended\nreconciled recorded\nrecruited reduced\nreferred regulated\nrehabilitated related\nremodeled repaired\nreported represented\nresearched restored\nrestructured retrieved\nreversed reviewed\nrevised revitalized\nsaved scheduled\nschooled screened\nselected serviced\nset shaped\nscreened selected\nsimplified skilled\nsold solidified\nsolved specified\nstimulated streamlined\nstrengthened suggested\nsummarized supervised\nsurveyed systemized\ntabulated taught\ntested trained\ntranslated traveled\ntrimmed updated\nupgraded validated\nworked wrote\nRESUME CRITIQUE LIST\nDoes the overall appearance make an employer want to read it?\nIs the layout professional?\nIs the information organized so it is easy to read? (If the employer just skims through it, would their eyes pick up the key points?)\nIs it well typed? (Do not mix print styles. Important titles should be underlined. Use bold and capital letters only when appropriate.)\nIs it printed on good quality paper? (Remember to avoid colored paper; it does not copy well.)\nAre all words spelled correctly? (Have your resume proof-read by a valued colleague.)\nIs the writing style clear? (Do not use jargon.)\nDo statements begin with action verbs and communicate accomplishments and results?\nAre verb tenses consistent? (Have your resume proof-read by someone who is good in English.)\nIs the employment objective well-written and clear? (Tailoring your resume to the job you are applying for increases your success rate.)\nIs the major discipline explained in brief if it is one that the employers may not understand?\nAre employment experiences listed in reverse chronological order?\nDo your strengths stand out? Is it easy to get a clear picture of your qualifications?\nDoes your resume stress accomplishments and skills more than responsibilities and duties?\nDoes your resume sell your problem-solving abilities?\nDoes your resume show volunteer work that might be relevant to the position sought?\nDid you account for all periods of time? (The employer will look for this.)\nHas irrelevant information been eliminated? Could your resume tell the same story if it were shortened?\nCan the same information be limited to one page?\nSAMPLE FUNCTIONAL RESUME\nSandra J.
