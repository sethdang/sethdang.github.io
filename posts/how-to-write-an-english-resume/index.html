    <title>How to write an english resume | Seth Dang博客</title>

    <meta name="description" content="An effective resume is the foundation of every successful job campaign. Most students write their first resume when they are seeking internships or summer employment, but resume writing skills are equally important for seniors approaching graduation and alumni seeking advancement.
As most people know, the purpose of the resume is to summarize the key elements of your past experience that you would like employers to consider when you are seeking employment. Naturally, a resume needs to be revised periodically during your career to reflect changes in your qualifications. Keep in mind that a good resume alone won&rsquo;t get you a job; however, it can help you get an interview and influence an employer&rsquo;s perception of your skills and potential for a particular kind of work.
There are several standard formats for resumes, but most employers prefer the chronological format, which is outlined and illustrated below. A few students might prefer to use a functional format to call attention to particular skill areas. Additional information on various resume formats is available in the Career Development Center. The organization of the resume can be adapted as necessary to emphasize an individual&rsquo;s most outstanding characteristics. In general, however, the resume should include:
IDENTIFICATION DATA: name, address (or two addresses&ndash;present and permanent), and phone number(s) (including area code).
OBJECTIVE: a single phrase expressing the specific type of employment you are seeking and/or the principal skills you want to use on the job. Some people prepare two or more resumes with different objectives. Once you formulate a clear objective, you can use it almost as a thesis for the remainder of your resume; only information that supports your career objective should be in
cluded on the resume.
EDUCATION: basic details about your education, including college location (city and state), degree, date of graduation (or expected graduation), major, related course work and (possibly) G.P.A. Most college students do not need to include information about secondary school, but it is important to summarize education attained through community colleges, other colleges (i.e., transfer credits), and specialized training programs.
EMPLOYMENT: brief summaries of principle employment to date. Start with your current (or most recent) position and work backward. Include all employment relevant to your career objective in any way. Internships and cooperative experience can be listed either under employment or under education.
Provide the name of the employer, the employer&rsquo;s location, your job title, dates of employment, and simple verb phrases to summarize your main activities on the job (see action verb list). When ever possible quantify and qualify data with specific details and statistics that illustrate your potential.">

Most students write their first resume when they are seeking internships or summer employment, but resume writing skills are equally important for seniors approaching graduation and alumni seeking advancement.<br>
As most people know, the purpose of the resume is to summarize the key elements of your past experience that you would like employers to consider when you are seeking employment. Naturally, a resume needs to be revised periodically during your career to reflect changes in your qualifications. Keep in mind that a good resume alone won&rsquo;t get you a job; however, it can help you get an interview and influence an employer&rsquo;s perception of your skills and potential for a particular kind of work.<br>
There are several standard formats for resumes, but most employers prefer the chronological format, which is outlined and illustrated below. A few students might prefer to use a functional format to call attention to particular skill areas. Additional information on various resume formats is available in the Career Development Center. The organization of the resume can be adapted as necessary to emphasize an individual&rsquo;s most outstanding characteristics. In general, however, the resume should include:<br>
IDENTIFICATION DATA: name, address (or two addresses&ndash;present and permanent), and phone number(s) (including area code).<br>
OBJECTIVE: a single phrase expressing the specific type of employment you are seeking and/or the principal skills you want to use on the job. Some people prepare two or more resumes with different objectives. Once you formulate a clear objective, you can use it almost as a thesis for the remainder of your resume; only information that supports your career objective should be in<br>

Provide the name of the employer, the employer&rsquo;s location, your job title, dates of employment, and simple verb phrases to summarize your main activities on the job (see action verb list). When ever possible quantify and qualify data with specific details and statistics that illustrate your potential.</p>
<p>ACTIVITIES/HONORS/SPECIAL SKILLS: additional areas that may be included on the resume if space allows. List all major activities and awards as well as any skills that are relevant to your career objective. These can show leadership, organization, critical thinking, teamwork, self management, initiative and influencing others.<br>
PERSONAL DATA: such as height, weight, sex, and marital status should not be listed on the resume. Such factors are irrelevant and cannot legally be considered in employment decisions.<br>
REFERENCES: and, in some cases, portfolios or transcripts can be listed as available upon request if you have enough room at the bottom of the resume.<br>
Have references, phone numbers, and business addresses ready on a separate sheet whenever you go to an interview.<br>
Remember to keep all information on the resume concise and clear. A one-page resume is best, although people with extensive experience or advanced degrees may have to use two pages. Be scrupulously careful when you proofread; some employers will refuse to consider candidates who submit resumes with spelling or typographical errors.<br>
ACTION VERBS FOR JOB DESCRIPTIONS<br>
Verb phrases are the strongest way to describe previous job responsibilities. To write verb phrases, pretend you&rsquo;re telling someone about your job, beginning each sentence with I. . . . For example, I supervise ten employees. I organize mass mailings. I arrange airline and hotel reservations. On the resume, you omit the I and use only the remaining verb phrases to descri<br>
be the work you do: Supervise ten employees. Organize mass mailings. Arrange airline and hotel reservations. Use present tense verb phrases for jobs you currently hold and past tense for former jobs. If you have any difficulty finding the right verbs to describe your work, choose from the following list:<br>
accomplished achieved<br>
acquired acted<br>
adapted addressed<br>
adjusted administered<br>
advanced advised<br>
allocated analyzed<br>

RESUME CRITIQUE LIST<br>
Does the overall appearance make an employer want to read it?<br>
Is the layout professional?<br>
Is the information organized so it is easy to read? (If the employer just skims through it, would their eyes pick up the key points?)<br>
Is it well typed? (Do not mix print styles. Important titles should be underlined. Use bold and capital letters only when appropriate.)<br>
Is it printed on good quality paper? (Remember to avoid colored paper; it does not copy well.)<br>
Are all words spelled correctly? (Have your resume proof-read by a valued colleague.)<br>
Is the writing style clear? (Do not use jargon.)<br>
Do statements begin with action verbs and communicate accomplishments and results?<br>
Are verb tenses consistent? (Have your resume proof-read by someone who is good in English.)<br>
Is the employment objective well-written and clear? (Tailoring your resume to the job you are applying for increases your success rate.)<br>
Is the major discipline explained in brief if it is one that the employers may not understand?<br>
Are employment experiences listed in reverse chronological order?<br>
Do your strengths stand out? Is it easy to get a clear picture of your qualifications?<br>
Does your resume stress accomplishments and skills more than responsibilities and duties?<br>
Does your resume sell your problem-solving abilities?<br>
Does your resume show volunteer work that might be relevant to the position sought?<br>
Did you account for all periods of time? (The employer will look for this.)<br>
Has irrelevant information been eliminated? Could your resume tell the same story if it were shortened?<br>
Can the same information be limited to one page?<br>
